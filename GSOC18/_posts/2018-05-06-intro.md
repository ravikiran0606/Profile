title: GSoC'18 @ CERN-HSF
---

Hi Everyone, I am glad to inform that I have been selected as a **Student Developer in Google Summer of Code 2018** at CERN-HSF. I am really excited to contribute to the project. I will be working on the project **"Additional Machine Learning Project Ideas and Areas of Interest"**.

>The project aims to implement the Optimization Modules ( Momentum-based, Adam, RMSProp ) in Machine learning and expand the deep learning libraries to include Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network ( LSTM ).

**CERN-HSF** (High-Energy Physics Software Foundation) is the umbrella organization for high-energy physics-related projects in GSoC. The [HEP Software Foundation](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.

**CERN** (European Organization for Nuclear Research, [http://www.cern.ch](http://www.cern.ch)) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments.

I hope that this summer will be interesting,challenging and productive.
